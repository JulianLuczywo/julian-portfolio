# Here are the software i rely on daily

## coding

### Windsurf

my primary IDE. i use it for all my coding needs. i've used cursor before too but for now Windsurf just works better with my workflow.
however, i'm thinking about giving cursor another go.

### Ghostty

my terminal. i have it set up exactly how i want it set up and i love it. i like the window options Ghostty gives you and being able to split the
screens, however i enjoy using temux so it doesn't matter too much. performance wise too it's much better than iTerm2.

**set up:**

- ohmyzsh
- powerlevel10k
- zsh-autosuggestions
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
- z (instead of cd)
- fzf (for fuzzy finding)

### Zen

my primary browser. i use it for all my browsing needs. i've used chrome before too but for now Zen just works better with my workflow. i love the
minimalistic approach that i can set up in it. it's just a clean look and i love minimalistic set ups. helps me focus.

## productivity

### Raycast

i've had a mac for a while and i've loved the spotlight search on it and i never thought i would change. changed to Raycast and one point and i
can't live without this anymore. it's basically the mac spotlight on steroids. everything just is easier on it. next mac i get this is going to
be the first time i set up genuinely.

### Notion

i've tried multiple note taking apps. from Notion to Obsidian to just Apple Notes. somehow i always end up coming back to Notion. i love it especially
because when i'm working with multiple people it's just so easy to share and collaborate on. my life is basically organised in Notion now. i have to say
that i enjoyed looking at the circle getting bigger in Obisidian as you added more, but in the end the organisation in Notion is just so much better.

### Notion Calendar

go-to calendar. organise my day-to-day in there and now that there are meeting you can schedule through it, it's a game changer.
