writing up a quick blog post about my coding set up and what i use to say productive and also efficient.

## tech stack

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Prisma
- Postgresql
- Clerk/Kinde for smaller projects
- WorkOs for enterprise

as of right now, this is my go-to tech stack for full-stack applications. as of right now this works the best for me. looking into some other options
too but i don't think i'll be switching any time soon.

i'm also looking into other options to add to the stack like Upstash for REDIS.

i also looked into t3 stack for when i start new projects but i'm not so familiar with tRPC so i need to look more into that. also been looking into
drizzle instead of prisma as it's linked with typescript, but prisma as of right now is doing it's job pretty well.

for the terminal i'm using Ghostty. i have temux set up there where i split the screen so that i can see the logs on the biggest screen and then the
smaller ones are to install the dependencies, etc. i know that you can split screen in Ghostty and it actually works well but i'm used to tmux and
i like it better there.
