writing up a quick blog post about my coding set up and what i use to say productive and also efficient.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Prisma
- Postgres
- Clerk/Kinde for smaller projects
- WorkOs for enterprise

as of right now, this is my go-to tech stack for full-stack applications. As of right now this works the best for me.

i'm also looking into other options to add to the stack like Upstash for REDIS.

for the terminal i'm using Ghostty. i have temux set up there where i split the screen so that i can see the logs on the biggest screen and then the smaller ones are to
install the dependencies, etc.
